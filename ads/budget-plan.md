## Key Assumptions & Risks

**Assumptions:**
- Average deal value: $8,000-$15,000 (residential smaller, commercial larger)
- Panama CPM: $3-8 (Facebook), $8-15 (Google Search)
- WhatsApp response rate: 60-80% (very high in Panama)
- No major competitor enters market in 3 months

**Risks:**
- Small audience size → ad fatigue faster (rotate creatives every 2-3 weeks)
- Expat audience may be seasonal (high season Nov-Apr = better)
- Lead quality from quiz/calculator may be lower → needs nurture sequence
- First month will be learning spend — expect higher CPL initially

**Mitigation:**
- Refresh creatives bi-weekly
- Segment reporting by audience (expat vs local vs business)
- WhatsApp follow-up within 1 hour of lead (speed = close rate)
- Track offline conversions back to ad source for true ROAS
