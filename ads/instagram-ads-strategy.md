## Visual Strategy

### Brand Aesthetic

- **Key visual elements:**
  - Drone shots of solar panels on terracotta/tropical roofs with ocean backdrop
  - Split-screen before/after (old roof vs. solar roof)
  - Sunset/golden hour shots of panels (solar = golden hour is on-brand)
  - Happy expats/owners in front of their solar homes
  - Electric bill comparisons (graphic overlays)

### Content Pillars
1. **Transformation** — Before/after installations
2. **Education** — Law 417 explainers, how solar works in tropics
3. **Lifestyle** — Solar = independence, modern living in paradise
4. **Numbers** — ROI breakdowns, savings calculations, bill comparisons
5. **Behind the scenes** — Installation process, team at work

  - Drone flyover of Pedasi → zoom into solar roof → text overlay with savings
  - "Things I wish I knew before buying property in Panama" → solar reveal
