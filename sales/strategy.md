2. **Build ROI templates** — Per-prospect calculations ready for each Tier 1 lead
3. **Prepare collateral** — Pitch deck (printed + PDF), one-pager in Spanish + English

- [ ] ROI calculator spreadsheet
- [ ] Printed pitch materials (bilingual)
- [ ] WhatsApp Business configured

## Phase 2: First Contact — Hotels & Resorts (Weeks 3-4)

### Why Hotels First?
1. **Expat owners** = faster decision cycles, English-speaking, solar-familiar
2. **High electricity bills** = obvious pain, easy ROI story
3. **Visible installations** = marketing for Solaris (other businesses see it)
4. **Eco-branding** = they WANT to tell guests about solar

### Target Order (Priority)
1. **Villa Camilla** — Largest roof (~2,955 m²), expat owners, direct WhatsApp available. Potential flagship project.
2. **Pedasi Sports Club** — Active community hub, Tom/Bob reachable by phone, good word-of-mouth amplifier.
3. **Casa Lajagua** — Canadian owners, email + phone available, boutique hotel = eco-branding fit.
4. **Selina Playa Venao** — Chain (corporate), but if closed = huge proof point. Approach local GM first.
5. **Villa Marina Lodge / Beach Break** — Smaller but easy wins, build momentum.

### Channel Strategy
- **First touch:** WhatsApp (English) — short, pain-focused, offer free assessment
- **Follow-up:** Email with satellite roof analysis + custom ROI
- **Close:** In-person visit with printed proposal

### Milestone: 2-3 site visits booked by end of Week 4

---

## Phase 3: Expand to Supermarkets (Weeks 5-6)

### Why Second?
- Corporate decision = longer cycle, start early
- Massive roofs = biggest projects by revenue
- Need a reference project to show (hotel from Phase 2)

### Target Order
1. **Super 99 Chitré** — Largest roof, highest traffic location
2. **Super 99 Las Tablas** — Same chain, bundle deal opportunity

### Channel Strategy
- **First touch:** Formal email (Spanish) to regional manager
- **Follow-up:** Phone call to request in-person meeting
- **Close:** Corporate proposal with ROI, presented in person
- **Timeline:** Expect 2-3 month sales cycle for corporate

### Milestone: Meeting with Super 99 regional decision-maker by Week 6

---

## Phase 4: Fincas & Agricultural (Weeks 5-8, parallel)

### Why Parallel with Supermarkets?
- Relationship-building takes time — start early
- Owner-operated = can close faster than corporate
- Different channel, different agent time

### Approach
- **Personal introductions** preferred — ask hotel owners if they know finca owners
- **WhatsApp (Spanish)** — warm, patient, relationship-first
- **On-site visits** — absolutely essential. Finca owners need to see you in person.
- **Value prop:** Reliability + cost savings for milking operations, refrigeration, water pumping

### Target Order
1. **Finca lechera Grade A** (La Villa) — 200 animals, high energy for milking
2. **Finca El Espinal** (Guararé) — Agro-industrial, labs + mill
3. **Finca Macaracas** — Largest operation, longest cycle

### Milestone: 2 finca site visits by Week 8

---

## Phase 5: Close & Deliver (Weeks 8-12)

### Actions
1. Convert site visits → signed contracts
2. Schedule installations for dry season (Dec-Apr optimal)
3. Begin ASEP net metering applications for signed projects
4. Photograph first installation for case study

### Closing Tactics
- **Urgency:** "Law 417 benefits are available now — policies can change"
- **Social proof:** "We're already working with [Hotel X] down the road"
- **Commitment cascade:** Small yeses → big yes
- **Offer flexibility:** Purchase for cash-ready, PPA for budget-constrained

---

## Phase 6: Referral Engine (Month 4+)

### Strategy
- Every completed installation → ask for 3 referrals
- Create case study (with permission): before/after electricity bill, photos, testimonial
- Post on local expat Facebook groups (Pedasi has active ones)
- Partner with local real estate agents (solar adds property value)

### Channels for Ongoing Lead Gen
1. **Word of mouth** — #1 in small-town Azuero
2. **Expat Facebook groups** — Pedasi, Azuero, Panama expat communities
3. **Local Chamber of Commerce** — Las Tablas / Chitré
4. **Encuentra24** — Panama's main classified/listing site
5. **Referral incentive** — $500 credit per referral that closes

## Sales Targets

| Period | Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Month 1 | Outreach sent | 15 prospects |
| Month 1 | Site visits | 4 |
| Month 2 | Proposals delivered | 6 |
| Month 3 | Contracts signed | 2-3 |
| Month 6 | Contracts signed (cumulative) | 8-10 |

## Key Success Factors

1. **Be local.** Azuero is a small community. Being present > any marketing.
2. **First reference project = everything.** Close Villa Camilla or Pedasi Sports Club first — everything else follows.
3. **Law 417 urgency is real.** Use it honestly — tax policies do change.
4. **Patience with Latin American pace.** Don't push Israeli-speed closing on Panamanian relationships. Build trust, the deals follow.
5. **Spanish fluency for fincas/supermarkets.** English works for expat hotels only.
6. **WhatsApp is king.** Not email, not cold calls. WhatsApp first, always.

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Law 417 changes | Close fast, use urgency honestly |
| Prospect ghosting | 14-day sequence with breakup message, then 90-day re-engage |
| Super 99 corporate stall | Build bottom-up with local managers + community pressure |
| Rainy season delays | Sign during rainy, install during dry (Dec-Apr) |
| Competitor enters market | First-mover advantage + reference projects + relationships |
