## Option 1: Outright Purchase

**Price range:** $1.00–$1.30 per watt installed (Panama market, incl. Law 417 benefits)

| System Size | Estimated Cost | Monthly Savings | Payback Period | 25-Year Net Savings |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 80 kW | $80,000-$104,000 | $1,900 | 3.5-4.5 years | $450,000+ |
| 150 kW | $150,000-$195,000 | $3,600 | 3.5-4.5 years | $850,000+ |
| 300 kW | $300,000-$390,000 | $7,200 | 3.5-4.5 years | $1,700,000+ |

**Law 417 Impact:**
- No import duties on panels, inverters, racking (~saves 10-15% on equipment)
- Tax deduction on system cost
- **Effective payback: 2.5-3.5 years after tax benefits**

**Best for:** Cash-ready owners who want maximum long-term ROI. Hotels/resorts with strong cash flow.

**Pitch:** "You own it forever. After year 3-4, it's free electricity for 20+ years."

## Option 2: PPA (Power Purchase Agreement)

**Structure:** Solaris owns the system. Customer buys energy at fixed rate below grid.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Upfront cost to customer | $0 |
| PPA rate | $0.14-$0.17/kWh (vs ~$0.20 grid) |
| Contract term | 15-20 years |
| Escalator | 1-2%/year (vs grid inflation of 3-5%) |
| Savings from Day 1 | 15-30% vs grid rate |
| End of term | Option to purchase at fair market value, renew, or remove |

**ROI for Customer:**
- 80 kW system → saves ~$450-$700/month immediately
- Over 20 years: $100,000-$160,000 cumulative savings
- $0 risk, $0 investment

**ROI for Solaris:**
- System cost: $80,000-$104,000
- Revenue: ~$1,300-$1,600/month
- Payback to Solaris: 5-7 years
- 20-year revenue: $310,000-$385,000

**Best for:** Budget-constrained businesses, fincas, businesses that prefer OPEX over CAPEX.

**Pitch:** "Imagine switching to a cheaper electricity provider — except the provider lives on your roof."

---

## Option 3: Lease

**Structure:** Fixed monthly payment. Customer gets all energy produced.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Upfront cost | $0 |
| Monthly lease payment | $800-$1,200 (for 80 kW system) |
| Term | 10-15 years |
| System output value | $1,900/month (at grid rate) |
| Net monthly savings | $700-$1,100/month |
| End of term | Purchase for $1, renew, or return |

**Best for:** Businesses wanting predictable costs and balance sheet simplicity.

**Pitch:** "Fixed payment, lower than your current bill. Simple."

## Comparison Summary for Sales Conversations

| Factor | Purchase | PPA | Lease |
|--------|----------|-----|-------|
| Upfront cost | $$$$ | $0 | $0 |
| Monthly savings | Highest (after payback) | Moderate | Moderate |
| Total 25-year savings | Highest | Moderate | Moderate |
| Risk to customer | Equipment ownership | None | Low |
| Decision speed | Slower (capital approval) | Fast | Fast |
| Best customer | Cash-rich owner | OPEX-focused | Predictability-focused |

## ROI Calculator (Use in Discovery Calls)

### Inputs Needed from Prospect:
1. Monthly electricity bill ($)
2. Roof area (m²) — or we estimate from satellite
3. Monthly consumption (kWh) — from factura

### Quick Formula:
```
System size (kW) = Usable roof (m²) × 0.15
Monthly production (kWh) = System size × 5.0 × 30 × 0.85
Monthly savings ($) = Monthly production × $0.20
Payback (years) = System cost / (Annual savings + Tax benefit)
```

### Example: Villa Camilla (~2,955 m² built, assume 1,500 m² usable roof)
- System: 225 kW
- Monthly production: ~28,700 kWh
- Monthly savings: ~$5,740
- System cost: ~$250,000
- Payback: ~3.6 years (before Law 417 benefits)
- **25-year savings: ~$1.4M**

### Example: Super 99 Chitré (~2,500 m² roof, 1,500 m² usable)
- System: 225 kW
- Monthly production: ~28,700 kWh
- Monthly savings: ~$5,740
- System cost: ~$250,000
- Payback: ~3.6 years
- **25-year savings: ~$1.4M**

### Example: Finca lechera (600 m² galera, 400 m² usable)
- System: 60 kW
- Monthly production: ~7,650 kWh
- Monthly savings: ~$1,530
- System cost: ~$66,000
- Payback: ~3.6 years
- **25-year savings: ~$393,000**

## Pricing Rules (Internal)

1. **Never discount the per-watt price.** If prospect pushes on price → add value (extended monitoring, faster install, additional panel cleaning visits)
2. **Always present Purchase first** (anchors high), then PPA as the "easy" alternative
3. **Customize ROI per prospect** using their actual electricity bill — generic numbers lose deals
4. **Law 417 is a closing tool** — "this tax benefit exists today, no guarantee it stays forever"
5. **Annual electricity inflation = urgency** — "every year you wait, your bill goes up but solar cost stays flat"
