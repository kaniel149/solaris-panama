# Partnerships Strategy — Solaris Panama

## Why Partnerships Matter
In Azuero, trusted local contacts are the fastest path to clients. A recommendation from someone's architect or banker carries more weight than any ad.

---

## 1. Electricians & Electrical Contractors

**Why:** They're already on commercial roofs. They get asked about solar.

**How to partner:**
- Identify 3-5 licensed electricians in Chitré, Las Tablas, Pedasí
- Offer: Subcontract electrical work on installations (revenue for them)
- Offer: $300-500 referral fee per closed deal
- Train on basic solar pitch ("when clients ask about solar, call us")

**Where to find them:**
- Cámara de Comercio directories
- Facebook groups: "Electricistas en Panamá"
- Ask at ferreterías (hardware stores) — they know everyone

---

## 2. Architects & Engineers

**Why:** They design commercial buildings. They influence building decisions.

**How to partner:**
- Approach architects who work on hotels/commercial in Azuero
- Offer: Include solar design in their proposals (we provide specs)
- Co-branded proposals: "Diseño arquitectónico + energía solar"
- Referral fee: $500 per project

**Key targets:**

## 3. Real Estate Agents / Developers

**Why:** Commercial property buyers/developers are prime solar prospects.

**How to partner:**
- "Solar-ready" assessment as value-add for property listings
- Co-marketing: "This property could save $X/year with solar"
- Referral fee per closed deal

**Focus on:**

## 4. Banks with Green Loans

**Why:** Financing removes the biggest objection ("too expensive upfront").

**Potential partners:**
- **Banco General** — largest bank, has sustainability initiatives
- **Banistmo** — green lending programs
- **Banco Nacional de Panamá** — government bank, may have development programs
- **Caja de Ahorros** — SME lending
- **IDB/CAF** — development finance for clean energy in Central America

**How to partner:**
- Approach with proposal: "Solar financing product for commercial clients"
- Show ROI data: loan payments < electricity savings from day 1
- Pre-approved financing = eliminates client friction
- Co-marketing: "Financiamiento solar con tasa preferencial"

---

## 5. Equipment Suppliers

**Why:** Reliable supply chain + potential volume discounts.

**Potential partners:**
- Panel distributors in Panama City (or direct import under Law 417 exemptions)
- Inverter brands: SolarEdge, Enphase, Huawei — seek authorized dealer status
- Regional distributors in Central America

---

## 6. Accountants & Tax Advisors

**Why:** They advise businesses on tax optimization. Law 417 = tax conversation.

**How to partner:**
- Educate local accountants on Law 417 benefits
- Provide them with a one-pager they can share with clients
- Referral fee: $200-300 per qualified lead

---

## 7. Hotel/Tourism Associations
