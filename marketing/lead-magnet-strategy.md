# Lead Magnet Strategy — Solaris Panama

## Principle
Every lead magnet answers one question: **"How much money will I save?"**
Business owners in Azuero don't care about kilowatts. They care about dollars.

## Lead Magnet #1: Free Solar Assessment (Primary)

**What:** On-site or remote roof evaluation with savings estimate.
**Value to prospect:** Custom numbers for THEIR building.
**Capture:** Landing page form, WhatsApp request, in-person ask.

**Process:**
1. Prospect fills form (name, business, monthly bill, location)
2. Kaniel reviews satellite imagery (Google Earth) for roof size/orientation
3. Preliminary savings report sent via WhatsApp (PDF)
4. Follow up with call to schedule on-site visit

**Why it works:** Zero risk for prospect. Creates obligation/reciprocity. Positions Solaris as expert.

**Delivery:** Within 48 hours of request.

## Lead Magnet #2: ROI Calculator (Website)

**What:** Interactive calculator on landing page.
**Input:** Monthly electricity bill + roof size estimate.
**Output:** Monthly savings, payback period, 25-year total savings, Law 417 benefit.

**Capture mechanism:**
- Show partial results immediately (hook them)
- "Para un análisis detallado, ingrese su información" → name + WhatsApp
- Full report emailed/WhatsApp'd as PDF

**Tech:** Simple JavaScript calculator on landing page. No complex backend needed.

## Lead Magnet #3: "Guía Ley 417" — Law 417 Savings Guide

**What:** 4-6 page PDF guide in Spanish.
**Content:**
- What Law 417 covers (plain language, not legal jargon)
- Exact tax exemptions and how to qualify
- Step-by-step process to apply
- How much a typical business saves
- "Solaris maneja todo el proceso por usted"

**Capture:** Download button on landing page → name + email + WhatsApp.
**Distribution:** Also share freely in WhatsApp groups and Facebook (builds authority even without capture).

## Lead Magnet #4: "Caso de Estudio" — ROI Case Study PDFs

**What:** 1-2 page PDFs showing savings for specific business types.

**Versions:**
1. **Hotel/Resort (60 rooms)** — from $4,500/mo to $1,200/mo
2. **Supermarket (800m² roof)** — from $3,000/mo to $900/mo  
3. **Large Farm/Processing** — from $2,500/mo to $700/mo
