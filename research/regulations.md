# Solaris Panama — Solar Regulations & Incentives
*Last updated: 2026-02-23*

## Executive Summary
- Law 417 (2024) = tax + import duty exemption on all solar equipment — major cost advantage
- Net metering exists but ASEP proposed controversial changes in Dec 2024 ("sun tax")
- Self-consumption cap at 3% of total system; up to 500 kW per installation

## Law 417 (2024) — Solar Incentives

### Tax Exemptions
- **Import duty exemption** on solar panels, inverters, batteries, mounting, cables, and all installation materials
- **Sales tax (ITBMS) exemption** on solar equipment purchases
- **Income tax benefits** for solar energy projects
- Applies to construction, operation, and maintenance of solar installations

### Scope
- Covers residential, commercial, and industrial installations
- Includes batteries and energy storage systems
- Effective 2024, no published sunset date

## ASEP Net Metering Rules

### Current Framework
- **Bidirectional metering**: energy generated vs. consumed tracked separately
- **1:1 credit**: kWh generated = kWh credit on bill
- **Excess production**: distribution company (ENSA or Naturgy) credits up to **25% of excess**
- **Self-consumption cap**: 3% of total system capacity
- **System size limit**: Up to 500 kW per installation (discussion to remove this cap)
- **Distribution companies**: ENSA (eastern Panama incl. Azuero) or Naturgy

### Market Stats (Late 2024)
- 3,325 self-consumption customers (up from 13 in 2014)
- 102,268 kW installed distributed capacity
- 170+ MW total distributed solar
- 6,000+ users nationwide

### ⚠️ Proposed Changes (Dec 2024)
- ASEP proposed **dual-rate tariff** and new billing mechanism
- Solar Chamber calls it a **"tax on the sun"**
- Would increase fixed costs for distributed generation customers
- Lengthens payback periods, discourages new installations
- Criticized for excluding users and installers from consultation (only distribution companies consulted)
- **Status:** ASEP expected to finalize in Jan 2025 — outcome TBD as of Feb 2026

## Permits Required

### Municipal Permits
1. **Construction permit** from local municipality (municipio)
2. **Site plan** submission
3. **Electrical schematics** and system design documents

### ASEP / Utility Process
1. **Application to ENSA** (for Azuero region) for interconnection
2. **Bidirectional meter installation** by ENSA
3. **Technical inspection** for building code and safety compliance
4. **Interconnection agreement** signed with distribution company

### Timeline (Typical)
- Municipal permits: 2-4 weeks
- ENSA interconnection approval: 4-8 weeks
- Total from application to energization: 6-12 weeks

---

## National Solar Capacity Context
- **695.55 MW** total installed solar (Dec 2024)
- **143.39 MW** added in 2024 alone
- **13.79%** of national electricity generation capacity
- Government target: **1.7 GW** renewable distributed generation by 2030
- Solar auction scheduled **July 2026** (200-250 MW utility-scale)

## Key Risks
1. **ASEP "sun tax" proposal** — if implemented, reduces ROI for all customers
2. **3% self-consumption cap** — may limit growth if not raised
3. **500 kW cap per installation** — limits very large commercial systems
4. **ENSA bureaucracy** — interconnection delays common in rural areas
5. **Policy uncertainty** — new government may change incentive structure
