# Solaris Panama — Solar Economics for 400m²+ Commercial Rooftop
*Last updated: 2026-02-23*

## Executive Summary
- Commercial electricity: **$0.195/kWh** (Jun 2025), trending up ~3%/year
- A 400m² roof supports ~60-80 kWp system → saves ~$1,500-2,500/month
- Estimated payback: **4-6 years** with Law 417 incentives; system life 25+ years

## Electricity Costs

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Commercial rate (Jun 2025) | **$0.195/kWh** | GlobalPetrolPrices |
| Rate trend | +2.7-3.7% annually | ENSA/EDEMET adjustments |
| Wholesale average (2024) | $0.173/kWh | Global Climatescope |
| Wholesale average (2023) | $0.199/kWh | Global Climatescope |

### Rate Increases
- ENSA customers >300 kWh: **+2.74%** adjustment (2026)
- EDEMET customers: **+3.7%** adjustment (2026)
- Driven by expiration of government subsidies (Additional FET)
- **Implication:** Rising rates = improving solar ROI over time

## Solar Production Estimates (Azuero Peninsula)

### Solar Resource
- **Average irradiance:** 5-6 kWh/m²/day (excellent)
- **Peak sun hours:** ~5.0-5.5 hrs/day average
- **Rainy season impact:** ~20-30% reduction May-November

### System Sizing for 400m² Roof
| Parameter | Conservative | Optimistic |
|---|---|---|
| Usable roof area | 320 m² (80%) | 360 m² (90%) |
| Panel density | 200 W/m² | 220 W/m² |
| System capacity | 64 kWp | 79 kWp |
| Annual production | ~96,000 kWh | ~130,000 kWh |
| Monthly production | ~8,000 kWh | ~10,800 kWh |

## Financial Model (70 kWp Reference System on 400m² Roof)

### Capital Costs
| Item | Cost (USD) |
|---|---|
| Solar panels (70 kWp) | $35,000-42,000 |
| Inverters | $7,000-10,000 |
| Mounting/racking | $5,000-7,000 |
| Wiring, combiner boxes | $3,000-4,000 |
| Installation labor | $8,000-12,000 |
| Permits & engineering | $2,000-3,000 |
| **Total (before Law 417)** | **$60,000-78,000** |
| **After Law 417 tax exemptions** | **~$50,000-65,000** |

*Note: Law 417 removes import duties + ITBMS (7%), saving ~15-20% on equipment costs.*

### Annual Savings
| Scenario | Annual Production | Savings @ $0.195/kWh |
|---|---|---|
| Conservative | 96,000 kWh | **$18,720/yr** ($1,560/mo) |
| Mid-range | 110,000 kWh | **$21,450/yr** ($1,788/mo) |
| Optimistic | 130,000 kWh | **$25,350/yr** ($2,113/mo) |

### Payback Period
| Scenario | System Cost | Annual Savings | Payback |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conservative | $65,000 | $18,720 | **3.5 years** |
| Mid-range | $58,000 | $21,450 | **2.7 years** |
| With rate increases (3%/yr) | $58,000 | $21,450 → growing | **2.5 years** |

### 25-Year ROI
- **Total savings over 25 years:** $500,000-700,000+ (with 3% annual rate increase)
- **Net profit after system cost:** $435,000-640,000
- **ROI:** 750-1,000%+
- **Panel degradation:** ~0.5%/year = 87.5% output at year 25

## Value Proposition by Customer Type

### Hotels/Resorts (400-2,000m² roof)
- Monthly electricity bill: $2,000-8,000+
- Solar savings: 50-80% of bill
- Green branding = premium pricing from eco-tourists
- Pool pumps + AC + kitchens = high base load = high self-consumption ratio

### Supermarkets (1,500-3,000m² roof)
- Monthly electricity bill: $5,000-15,000+
- 24/7 refrigeration = perfect solar match (daytime peak)
- Flat roof = easy installation, optimal tilt
- Chain stores = replicable model

### Fincas/Galeras (400-1,000m² roof)
- Monthly electricity bill: $500-3,000
- Milking equipment, refrigeration, lighting
- Often unreliable grid = solar + battery = operational resilience
- Simpler installations on metal roofs

## Key Assumptions & Caveats
1. Costs based on international benchmarks adapted to Panama; actual quotes may vary
2. Law 417 exemptions assumed to remain in effect
3. Net metering at 1:1 credit assumed (ASEP "sun tax" proposal could impact)
4. No battery storage included (adds $10,000-20,000 but improves self-consumption)
5. Maintenance cost: ~$500-1,000/year (cleaning, monitoring, minor repairs)
